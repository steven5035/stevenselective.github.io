            img {
                width: 500px;
                height: 500px;

        </style>
    <p>
        Go to setting and scroll down until you found this page ,make sure to follow the setting i use and name the website link to what you want.
    </p>
    <p>And there you have it,your very first website.</p>
    <br> <br> <br>
    <p>
        What is HTML and CSS?
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        HTML is a code that is responsible to the main structural of the webpage ,like buttons ,paragraphs of words ,etc
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        CSS however is resposible for the animation and decoration of the website for expample...Hover your mouse on top of the buttons on top of the website ,there will be a yellow bar appearing
    </p>
    <p>
        That yellow bar is created by CSS code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br> <br>
        If u want to know how this website code looks like ,u can go to the "Website Code" on top of the website to see.
